# Adapter Quick Demo Developer Repository

This is the developer repository for the Arrowhead Quick Demo bundles. By forking this repo you can start up an Arrowhead Adapter environment quickly and you also can use the source code to develope new services that fit your application scenario.

Please follow the docs (that is provided in PDF or DOCX format) for installation instructions. The bundle is composed in a way that users can immediately upload the pre-compiled program onto their devices along with its configuration files. For developement purposes you might like to ignore this step and modify as well as compile the source code with the Arduino IDE.
